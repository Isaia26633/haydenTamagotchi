            <h3>Hunger System</h3>

            <p>Your Tamagotchi needs to eat! To keep it healthy, you'll need to feed it two types of food:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meals:</strong> These satisfy hunger.</li>
                <li><strong>Diet Coke:</strong> While this won't fill your pet's hunger, it will improve its mood and happiness.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be careful not to overfeed your Tamagotchi, as it can get sick from eating too much.</p>
            <p> Watch the hunger meter to ensure it doesn't drop too low!</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Happiness System</h3>
            <p>Your Tamagotchi has emotional needs too. To keep it happy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Play mini-games with it.</li>
                <li>Give it <strong>Diet Coke</strong> (but be careful not to overdo it).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If it becomes unhappy, it may start refusing to follow commands or even get sick.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Health System</h3>
            <p>Just like a real pet, your Tamagotchi can fall ill if not cared for properly. Signs of illness include
                refusal to eat or acting sluggish.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the <strong>medicine</strong> function when it gets sick to restore its health.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If left untreated for too long, your Tamagotchi may pass away.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Discipline System</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, your Tamagotchi will misbehave. You'll need to use the discipline function to correct bad
                behavior. However, it's important to balance discipline with care, as too much scolding can lower its
                happiness.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Cleanliness</h3>
            <p>Your Tamagotchi will poop regularly, and it's your job to keep its environment clean.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the <strong>clean-up</strong> function to remove any droppings..</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Neglecting this can lead to unhappiness and even illness, so keep a close eye on your pet’s cleanliness.
            </p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Sleep Cycle</h3>
            <p>Your Tamagotchi has a natural sleep schedule. When it gets tired:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Turn off the lights to help it sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Letting it rest regularly ensures it stays healthy and happy.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3>Growth and Evolution</h3>
            <p>As you care for your Tamagotchi, it will grow and evolve through different life stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Baby → Child → Teen → Adult</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your care will affect which form it evolves into, adding a layer of personalization to your pet's
                development.</p>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>へイデンゴッチ is a virtual pet game where you take care of a virtual pet named Hayden. You can feed, play, and
                discipline Hayden to keep him happy and healthy. If you neglect Hayden, he will get sick and eventually
                die. The goal of the game is to keep Hayden alive as long as possible.</p>
